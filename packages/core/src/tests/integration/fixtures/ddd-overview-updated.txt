Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on
modeling software to match a domain according to input from domain experts.

Key Concepts (Updated with Strategic Patterns):
1. Bounded Context: A boundary within which a particular domain model is defined.
2. Aggregate: A cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit.
3. Entity: An object defined by its identity rather than its attributes.
4. Value Object: An object defined by its attributes, immutable and shareable.
5. Repository: Encapsulates storage, retrieval, and search for aggregate roots.
6. Context Map: Shows relationships between bounded contexts.
7. Anti-Corruption Layer: Protects domain from external model corruption.
8. Shared Kernel: A shared model subset agreed upon by multiple teams.

Strategic DDD emphasizes the importance of context boundaries and team topology.
Tactical DDD focuses on patterns within a single bounded context.
