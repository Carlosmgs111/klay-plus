Event Sourcing stores all changes to application state as a sequence of events.
Instead of storing the current state, it records every state change as an event.
The current state is reconstructed by replaying all events from the beginning.

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates read and write models.
Commands change state. Queries return data without side effects.
Combined with Event Sourcing, CQRS provides a powerful architecture pattern
for complex domains with high audit requirements.

Benefits: Complete audit trail, temporal queries, event-driven integration,
and the ability to rebuild projections from the event store.
