Clean Architecture separates concerns into concentric layers.
The innermost layer contains enterprise business rules (Entities),
followed by application business rules (Use Cases),
interface adapters, and frameworks/drivers on the outermost layer.

The Dependency Rule states that source code dependencies can only point inward.
Nothing in an inner circle can know anything about something in an outer circle.
This includes functions, classes, variables, or any software entity.

Benefits: Independent of frameworks, testable business rules,
independent of UI, database, and external agencies.
