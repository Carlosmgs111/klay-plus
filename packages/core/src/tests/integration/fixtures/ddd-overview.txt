Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on
modeling software to match a domain according to input from domain experts.

Key Concepts:
1. Bounded Context: A boundary within which a particular domain model is defined.
2. Aggregate: A cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit.
3. Entity: An object defined by its identity rather than its attributes.
4. Value Object: An object defined by its attributes, immutable and shareable.
5. Repository: Encapsulates storage, retrieval, and search for aggregate roots.

Benefits: Better alignment between software and business requirements,
improved communication through ubiquitous language, clear boundaries.
